# Travelers Path **(Live Link - https://travelers-path.herokuapp.com/)**

1) **Problem statement** - A random graph is generated where nodes represent cities and edges represent either a **Bus route** or a **Plane Route**.
  We are required to find a source to destination path which consumes the least cost.
  But the contraint is that we can only use a **Plane Route once** in a possible path.
  
2) **Origin** - Like **Google Maps** allows us to find sortest path from source to destination using **multiple transportation methods** to consume least amount of time.

3) **Solution** - Uses Dijkstra's algorithm which allows us to find the shortest path between any two vertices of a graph.
